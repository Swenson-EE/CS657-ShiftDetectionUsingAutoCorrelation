1. Load the two images f and f2 into your chosen programming language (Matlab, Python, or C).

2. Convert the images to grayscale if they are not already in grayscale.

3. Calculate the Fourier transforms Fi and F of the two images using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This can be done using the fft2 function in Matlab, the numpy.fft.fft2 function in Python, or the FFTW library in C.

4. Calculate the cross-power spectrum by multiplying the Fourier transforms element-wise and taking the complex conjugate of one of them. In Matlab, this can be done using the .* and conj functions. In Python, you can use the * and np.conj functions. In C, you can use the complex multiplication and conjugation operations.

5. Take the inverse Fourier transform of the cross-power spectrum to obtain the correlation function. In Matlab, you can use the ifft2 function. In Python, you can use the np.fft.ifft2 function. In C, you can use the FFTW library.

6. Normalize the correlation function by dividing it by the product of the magnitudes of the Fourier transforms Fi and F. This can be done by dividing the correlation function by the absolute value of the product of the Fourier transforms. In Matlab, you can use the ./ and abs functions. In Python, you can use the / and np.abs functions. In C, you can use the complex division and absolute value operations.

7. Find the peak of the correlation function, which corresponds to the optimal displacement needed to register the two images. This can be done by finding the maximum value and its corresponding indices in the correlation function. In Matlab, you can use the max function. In Python, you can use the np.max function. In C, you can iterate through the correlation function and keep track of the maximum value and its indices.

8. The displacement needed to register the two images is given by the indices of the peak in the correlation function. In Matlab and Python, the indices are given as (row, column) or (y, x) coordinates. In C, the indices are given as (x, y) coordinates.

9. You can then apply the displacement to one of the images to align it with the other image. In Matlab and Python, you can use the circshift function to shift the image. In C, you can iterate through the pixels of the image and assign the values of the shifted image accordingly.

10. Finally, you can display the aligned images to visually verify the registration. In Matlab, you can use the imshow function. In Python, you can use the plt.imshow function. In C, you can save the aligned image to a file or display it using a library such as OpenCV. Note: This is a general outline of the steps involved in shift detection using image correlation. The specific implementation may vary depending on the programming language and libraries used.
